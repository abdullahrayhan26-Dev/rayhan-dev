  <h1 class="about-title">About Me</h1>

  <!-- 🔁 REPLACE intro text -->
  <p class="about-intro">
    From a very young age, I grew up around computers. My father is a computer expert, and even before I fully understood what technology was, I always had a personal PC in my room. Watching him work sparked my curiosity. 
    I wanted to understand how they worked. As a child, I spent hours exploring, experimenting, and learning on my own. Programming slowly became more than an interest; it became a passion. 
    Over time, that curiosity pushed me to study deeper, try new technologies, and constantly improve my skills. 
    Today, I continue learning with the same excitement, growing both in my technical knowledge and my professional journey.

        <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
        <!-- 🔁 REPLACE text -->
        <p>
          Along with design and coding, I bring strong leadership and people skills. From school to college and university, I’ve often taken leadership roles—in sports, group work, and student activities. Currently, 
          I serve as a Class Representative and hold leadership positions in university clubs, which has strengthened my ability to guide teams, manage time, and handle multiple tasks smoothly. 
          I am strong at problem-solving and enjoy turning complex challenges into clear, effective solutions. Through challenging projects, I’ve learned how to stay organized, adapt quickly, and keep learning. 
          I enjoy building smart, useful applications and always focus on adding real value to every project I work on.

        <h3>Development & Projects</h3>
        <!-- 🔁 REPLACE text -->
        <p>
         I enjoy transforming ideas into real, working products through clean and thoughtful coding. I focus on clear planning, improving performance, and paying close attention to small details to deliver quality results. 
          Every project is a chance for me to solve problems, learn something new, and exceed expectations. Seeing an idea come to life through my work is what motivates me the most.

      <h3>Security & Privacy</h3>
      <!-- 🔁 REPLACE text -->
      <p>
        I take security and privacy seriously in everything I build. Protecting user data is always a priority, so I follow safe coding practices and use reliable security measures. 
        I stay aware of new threats and continuously improve my approach to keep information protected. Building trust through a safe and secure user experience is something I truly care about.

      <h3>Constant Learning</h3>
      <!-- 🔁 REPLACE text -->
      <p>
        I believe learning never stops. I’m always curious to explore new tools, technologies, and ideas that help me grow both personally and professionally. I enjoy taking on new challenges because they push me to improve my skills and think in better ways. 
        By staying updated with modern trends, I aim to create smarter solutions and offer meaningful value in every project I work on.
